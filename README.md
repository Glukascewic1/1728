# How To Play
In this version of the game, it spawns 12s instead of 1s. Also, <strong>any number of</strong> tiles in a row will merge into one, not just two. You are trying to create 1728, which is only possible by merging 3 in a row a few times, which is considerably harder to do on purpose than just two. <br>
